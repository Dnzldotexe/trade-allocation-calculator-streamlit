# ðŸ“±What is a Position Size Calculator?

A position size calculator is used by traders to precisely calculate their position size for every trade.   

Precisely calculating position size for every trade is crucial for a trader's portfolio as it allows them to manage their risk on a trade.  

I developed this Position Size Calculator sprecifically for Futures Contracts Cryptocurrency Trading. As I have seen some calculators being limited only three variables (Leverage not considered into account).    

This Position Size calculator allows Traders to input all four (Account Balance, Risk, Leverage, and Stop Loss) variables to precisely measure the position size with the added bonus of a formula on top.  

Note: Another feature might be added in where the client could input the entry price and the exit price.
